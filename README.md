# Hi there! 👋 I'm an Android Developer & Tech Enthusiast

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Amaanprobably&color=blue)

I am a Computer Science student and aspiring Android Engineer who loves to experiment and push the boundaries of what's possible in mobile development. I'm passionate about building clean, offline-first experiences and am actively seeking a **part-time/full-time Android development internship/job** where I can contribute to impactful products.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On
* 🎮 **Building a Game Engine:** I am currently developing my own custom game engine from scratch and actively building a game on top of it.
* 🚀 **Future Vision:** I plan to evolve this engine into a dedicated, open-source library that any developer can easily plug into their Android apps to add rich, interactive minigames.
* 📱 **Modern Android Apps:** Continuously improving my portfolio projects (like my offline-first Pokedex app) using modern architecture and the latest Jetpack libraries.
